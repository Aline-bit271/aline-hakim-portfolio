Project Title: GoTogether ‚Äì A Carpooling Application for Lebanon

Objective:
To reduce transportation costs and traffic in Lebanon by connecting drivers and passengers through a digital ride-sharing platform.

Tools & Stack:
- Flutter (Frontend)
- .NET Core Web API (Backend)
- SQL Server (Database)

System Overview:
GoTogether allows users to register as drivers or passengers. Drivers can offer rides and passengers can search and book them.

Backend Functionality:
- API endpoints for login, ride creation, booking, rating
- Secure authentication using JWT tokens

Database Tables:
- Users: ID, Name, Email, PasswordHash, Role
- Rides: ID, From, To, Date, Time, Seats, DriverID
- Bookings: ID, RideID, UserID, Status
- Ratings: ID, ReviewerID, RevieweeID, Score, Comment

Conclusion:
GoTogether improves commute sharing, cuts fuel costs, and is scalable for national rollout. Future work includes chat features and payment integration.

  <h2>üó£Ô∏è Interview Assignment ‚Äì Sample Questions & Answers</h2>
  <div class="card">
    <pre>
Q1: What is your main academic project?
A: My main project is GoTogether, a ride-sharing mobile application built with Flutter and .NET Core, designed to help Lebanese commuters share rides.

Q2: Explain OOP concepts you‚Äôve used.
A: I used classes, inheritance, and encapsulation in Flutter and .NET to build reusable and secure backend and frontend modules.

Q3: What is the difference between TCP and UDP?
A: TCP is connection-oriented, reliable, and ensures packet order. UDP is faster, connectionless, and does not guarantee delivery.

Q4: What is a foreign key in SQL?
A: A foreign key links records in one table to another, enforcing referential integrity between tables.

Q5: Describe your internship at Ogero.
A: I worked with telecom engineers configuring routers and installing fiber optic systems, learning real-world networking and signal flow.
